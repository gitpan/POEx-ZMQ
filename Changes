0.001002 2014-08-03

  - Issue a warning when queuing app-side on EFSM.
    The socket is probably not being used as intended, but since our sockets
    should never block, it's still maybe valid to queue up messages headed to
    REP (for example).
    Application-side queue management is definitely not finalized; this
    behavior is likely to change.

  - Add 'ipv6' attr to handle appropriate socket options automatically

  - Port a couple of examples/ from the deprecated POEx-ZMQ3 dist

  - Be smarter about choosing ipc:// endpoints for tests

  - Expanded tests (somewhat, test suite is still woefully incomplete)

  - Issue warnings when buffering on EFSM

  - More Constants.pm fixes/cleanups

0.000_006 2014-07-30

  - Add max_queue_size / max_queue_action

  - Test TCP transport

0.000_005 2014-07-27

  - Provide ->zmq_version method on POEx::ZMQ::Socket objs

  - BAIL_OUT on some other possible linker failures

  - Don't bother trying to clean up sockets & contexts properly if in GD

0.000_004 2014-07-27

  - Fix dep list

  - Requeue on EFSM
    (Still need proper internal queue management.)

0.000_003 2014-07-27

  - Provide POEx::ZMQ->socket() constructor shortcut
